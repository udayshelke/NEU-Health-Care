NU HEALTHCARE SYSTEM - WE CARE


PROBLEM STATEMENT:
NU healthcare is a complex model developed by the campus for the campus for anyone who comes under NU where various hospitals and doctors encountered the most difficult experiences and unavoidable issues such as anticipating the number of NU members as patients, a lack of resources, efficient tracking, and access to medical provisions.
To avoid repeating any difficulties, the provision of medical services should be the NU campus's first priority in any other medical concern.
